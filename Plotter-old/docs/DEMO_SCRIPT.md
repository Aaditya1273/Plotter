# Meta-Plot AI Demo Script 🎬

**For MetaMask Developer Hackathon Submission**

## 🎯 Demo Objective
Show judges how Meta-Plot AI transforms DeFi from manual, friction-heavy processes into seamless, intent-driven automation using MetaMask's Advanced Permissions.

## 📝 Demo Script (3-5 minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
> "Imagine telling your wallet: 'Keep $100 liquid, invest the rest in the best yield weekly when gas is cheap' - and it just works. No more popups, no more missed opportunities. That's Meta-Plot AI."

**Screen**: Landing page with the hero section

### Problem Setup (45 seconds)
> "Current DeFi is broken. Users abandon transactions due to endless approvals, high gas fees, and manual monitoring. Look at this typical flow..."

**Screen**: Show traditional DeFi flow mockup with multiple MetaMask popups

> "5+ signatures for a simple weekly investment. 70% abandonment rate. This is why users flee to embedded wallets, leaving MetaMask behind."

### Solution Introduction (60 seconds)
> "Meta-Plot AI fixes this with three breakthrough technologies:"

**Screen**: Connect wallet with RainbowKit

> "1. **Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715)** - Grant scoped, revocable permissions once"
> "2. **Intent-Driven AI** - Natural language to structured automation"  
> "3. **Real-time Indexing** - Envio powers instant transparency"

**Screen**: Chat interface appears after wallet connection

### Live Demo - Core Flow (90 seconds)

**Action**: Type in chat: "Keep $100 USDC liquid, invest any extra in Aave weekly when gas is under 30 gwei and APY is above 5%"

> "Watch the AI parse my intent in real-time..."

**Screen**: AI response with parsed parameters and permission request

**Action**: Click "Approve Permission"

> "One signature grants a scoped permission - only Aave, only USDC, time-limited, revocable anytime."

**Screen**: MetaMask permission popup (mock), then success message

**Action**: Switch to Dashboard tab

> "Now my agent is live. Look at this real-time dashboard powered by Envio's HyperSync..."

**Screen**: Dashboard showing active permission, portfolio chart, recent activities

### Advanced Features (45 seconds)

**Screen**: Point to permission management section

> "Full control - pause, resume, or revoke instantly. Every action is transparent."

**Screen**: Show activity feed

> "Real-time activity feed shows exactly what my agent is doing. Gas optimization, yield monitoring, automatic execution."

**Action**: Click on an activity item

> "Complete audit trail with transaction hashes, all indexed by Envio for sub-second updates."

### Innovation Highlight (30 seconds)

> "This isn't just automation - it's the future of Web3 UX. Agent-to-Agent delegation, intent-centric design, and MetaMask-native security."

**Screen**: Show A2A delegation concept or architecture diagram

> "Built exclusively for MetaMask's Advanced Permissions, proving that smart wallets don't require new infrastructure."

### Closing Impact (30 seconds)

> "Meta-Plot AI transforms DeFi from reactive to proactive. Users set intent once, agents handle everything else. This is how we keep MetaMask relevant in an agentic future."

**Screen**: Return to landing page or summary slide

> "One signature. Infinite automation. Zero friction. That's Meta-Plot AI."
