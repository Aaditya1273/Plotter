Description
The MetaMask Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715)  invites developers, designers, and innovators to build next-generation Web3 experiences focused on permissions, and Wallet UX.
About Advanced Permissions
 
The Smart Accounts Kit supports Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715), which lets you request fine-grained permissions from a MetaMask user to execute transactions on their behalf. 
For example, a user can grant your dapp permission to spend 10 USDC per day to buy ETH over the course of a month. Once the permission is granted, your dapp can use the allocated 10 USDC each day to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask user's account.
 
About Envio
 
Envio is a high-performance blockchain indexer designed to track events and state changes across multiple networks with speed and efficiency. Built on its HyperSync engine, it enables developers to easily query blockchain data through GraphQL, providing real-time, production-ready APIs.
Qualification Requirements
 
The project should use MetaMask Advanced Permissions. Advanced Permissions are only supported on the chains that have EIP-7702 support. Check the supported networks.
To integrate Advanced Permissions use the Smart Accounts Kit.
The project demo video should have a working Advanced Permissions depicted in the main flow of the application.
The judges can decide not to reward a track prize if no project meets the standards set by them internally, apart from the basic submission criteria.
If you are using Envio, the project demo should show how you are using Envio in the project.

Judging Criteria
Integrate Advanced Permissions into your existing dApp.This track is for teams with an existing dApp who want to integrate Advanced Permissions to automate transactions on behalf of their users.
 
Possible Directions
 
If your dApp or protocol includes an on-chain agent, it can request permissions from MetaMask to spend ERC-20 or native tokens on behalf of the user.
If your dApp focuses on automation, you can request permissions to spend ERC-20 or native tokens to perform on-chain actions such as recurring swaps or DCA orders.
