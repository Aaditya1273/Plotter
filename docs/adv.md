Perform executions on a MetaMask user's behalf
Advanced Permissions (ERC-7115) are fine-grained permissions that your dapp can request from a MetaMask user to execute transactions on their behalf. For example, a user can grant your dapp permission to spend 10 USDC per day to buy ETH over the course of a month. Once the permission is granted, your dapp can use the allocated 10 USDC each day to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask user's account.

In this guide, you'll request an ERC-20 periodic transfer permission from a MetaMask user to transfer 1 USDC every day on their behalf.

Prerequisites
Install and set up the Smart Accounts Kit
Install MetaMask Flask 13.5.0 or later
Steps
1. Set up a Wallet Client
Set up a Viem Wallet Client using Viem's createWalletClient function. This client will help you interact with MetaMask Flask.

Then, extend the Wallet Client functionality using erc7715ProviderActions. These actions enable you to request Advanced Permissions from the user.

import { createWalletClient, custom } from "viem";
import { erc7715ProviderActions } from "@metamask/smart-accounts-kit/actions";

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
}).extend(erc7715ProviderActions());
2. Set up a Public Client
Set up a Viem Public Client using Viem's createPublicClient function. This client will help you query the account state and interact with the blockchain network.

import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { sepolia as chain } from "viem/chains";
 
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain,
  transport: http(),
});
3. Set up a session account
Set up a session account which can either be a smart account or an externally owned account (EOA) to request Advanced Permissions. The requested permissions are granted to the session account, which is responsible for executing transactions on behalf of the user.

Smart account
EOA
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { 
  toMetaMaskSmartAccount, 
  Implementation 
} from "@metamask/smart-accounts-kit";

const privateKey = "0x...";
const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

const sessionAccount = await toMetaMaskSmartAccount({
  client: publicClient,
  implementation: Implementation.Hybrid,
  deployParams: [account.address, [], [], []],
  deploySalt: "0x",
  signer: { account },
});
4. Check the EOA account code
With MetaMask Flask 13.9.0 or later, Advanced Permissions support automatically upgrading a user’s account to a MetaMask smart account. On earlier versions, upgrade the user to a smart account before requesting Advanced Permissions.

If the user has not yet been upgraded, you can handle the upgrade programmatically or ask the user to switch to a smart account manually.

Why is a Smart Account upgrade is required?
MetaMask's Advanced Permissions (ERC-7115) implementation requires the user to be upgraded to a MetaMask Smart Account because, under the hood, you're requesting a signature for an ERC-7710 delegation. ERC-7710 delegation is one of the core features supported only by MetaMask Smart Accounts.

import { getSmartAccountsEnvironment } from "@metamask/smart-accounts-kit";
import { sepolia as chain } from "viem/chains";

const addresses = await walletClient.requestAddresses();
const address = addresses[0];

// Get the EOA account code
const code = await publicClient.getCode({
  address,
});

if (code) {
  // The address to which EOA has delegated. According to EIP-7702, 0xef0100 || address
  // represents the delegation. 
  // 
  // You need to remove the first 8 characters (0xef0100) to get the delegator address.
  const delegatorAddress = `0x${code.substring(8)}`;

  const statelessDelegatorAddress = getSmartAccountsEnvironment(chain.id)
  .implementations
  .EIP7702StatelessDeleGatorImpl;

  // If account is not upgraded to MetaMask smart account, you can
  // either upgrade programmatically or ask the user to switch to a smart account manually.
  const isAccountUpgraded = delegatorAddress.toLowerCase() === statelessDelegatorAddress.toLowerCase();
}
5. Request Advanced Permissions
Request Advanced Permissions from the user with the Wallet Client's requestExecutionPermissions action. In this example, you'll request an ERC-20 periodic permission.

See the requestExecutionPermissions API reference for more information.

import { sepolia as chain } from "viem/chains";
import { parseUnits } from "viem";

// Since current time is in seconds, we need to convert milliseconds to seconds.
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
// 1 week from now.
const expiry = currentTime + 604800;

// USDC address on Ethereum Sepolia.
const tokenAddress = "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238";

const grantedPermissions = await walletClient.requestExecutionPermissions([{
  chainId: chain.id,
  expiry,
  signer: {
    type: "account",
    data: {
      // The requested permissions will granted to the
      // session account.
      address: sessionAccount.address,
    },
  },
  permission: {
    type: "erc20-token-periodic",
    data: {
      tokenAddress,
      // 1 USDC in WEI format. Since USDC has 6 decimals, 10 * 10^6
      periodAmount: parseUnits("10", 6),
      // 1 day in seconds
      periodDuration: 86400,
      justification?: "Permission to transfer 1 USDC every day",
    },
  },
  isAdjustmentAllowed: true,
}]);
6. Set up a Viem client
Set up a Viem client depending on your session account type.

For a smart account, set up a Viem Bundler Client using Viem's createBundlerClient function. This lets you use the bundler service to estimate gas for user operations and submit transactions to the network.

For an EOA, set up a Viem Wallet Client using Viem's createWalletClient function. This lets you send transactions directly to the network.

The toolkit provides public actions for both of the clients which can be used to redeem Advanced Permissions, and execute transactions on a user's behalf.

Smart account
EOA
import { createBundlerClient } from "viem/account-abstraction";
import { erc7710BundlerActions } from "@metamask/smart-accounts-kit/actions";

const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
  client: publicClient,
  transport: http("https://your-bundler-rpc.com"),
  // Allows you to use the same Bundler Client as paymaster.
  paymaster: true
}).extend(erc7710BundlerActions());
7. Redeem Advanced Permissions
The session account can now redeem the permissions. The redeem transaction is sent to the DelegationManager contract, which validates the delegation and executes actions on the user's behalf.

To redeem the permissions, use the client action based on your session account type. A smart account uses the Bundler Client's sendUserOperationWithDelegation action, and an EOA uses the Wallet Client's sendTransactionWithDelegation action.

See the sendUserOperationWithDelegation and sendTransactionWithDelegation API reference for more information.

Smart account
EOA
config.ts
import { calldata } from "./config.ts";

// These properties must be extracted from the permission response.
const permissionsContext = grantedPermissions[0].context;
const delegationManager = grantedPermissions[0].signerMeta.delegationManager;

// USDC address on Ethereum Sepolia.
const tokenAddress = "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238";

// Calls without permissionsContext and delegationManager will be executed 
// as a normal user operation.
const userOperationHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperationWithDelegation({
  publicClient,
  account: sessionAccount,
  calls: [
    {
      to: tokenAddress,
      data: calldata,
      permissionsContext,
      delegationManager,
    },
  ],
  // Appropriate values must be used for fee-per-gas. 
  maxFeePerGas: 1n,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: 1n,
});
