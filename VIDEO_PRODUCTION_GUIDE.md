## **SCENE-BY-SCENE PRODUCTION**

### **Scene 1: Opening Hook (0:00-0:15)**

**What to Record:**
```
Split Screen Setup:

- Multiple MetaMask popups
- User clicking "Confirm" repeatedly  
- Gas fee anxiety (high gwei prices)
- Transaction failures

RIGHT: MetaArmy (smooth)
- Clean chat interface
- Single permission grant
- Autonomous execution
```

**Recording Tips:**
- Use a timer to show "5 popups in 30 seconds" vs "1 click, done"
- Show actual gas prices (use high gwei for dramatic effect)
- Record the MetaArmy interface with smooth animations

**Narration Tone:** Confident, slightly dramatic, building excitement
